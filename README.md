# Hangman

Yet another Hangman game written using Spring Boot on backend and React on front. 

## How to run

### For starting backend: 

You may either:

 - Run the ServerApplication class.
 - Run `gradlew bootRun` under server folder.

### For starting frontend:

  Run `npm start` under ui folder.
  
Have fun!
